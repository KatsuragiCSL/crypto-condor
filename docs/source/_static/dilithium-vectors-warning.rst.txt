.. caution::

    Currently, |cc| uses test vectors for version `3.1
    <https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium/releases/tag/v3.1>`_ of Dilithium, which
    is the latest release of the reference implementation. This version differs slightly
    from the one submitted to the third round of the NIST competition. It also differs
    from the draft for `ML-DSA <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd>`_, the NIST
    standard.  The test vectors are not compatible between versions.

    As 3.1 is the latest release, we do not intend to support version 3. Regarding
    ML-DSA, it is currently a draft, so it is subject to change, and NIST hasn't
    released test vectors for it.  Once the final version is published with accompanying
    vectors it will integrated into |cc|.
