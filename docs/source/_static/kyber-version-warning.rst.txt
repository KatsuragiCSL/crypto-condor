.. caution::

    Currently, |cc| uses test vectors for version `3.0
    <https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/releases/tag/v3.0>`_ of Kyber, which is the
    latest release of the reference implementation. This version differs from the FIPS
    draft for `ML-KEM <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd>`_. When the final is
    published, its test vectors will be integrated into |cc|.
