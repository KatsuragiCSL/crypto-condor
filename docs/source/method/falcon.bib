	abstract = {We show how to construct a variety of “trapdoor” cryptographic tools assuming the worst-case hardness of standard lattice problems (such as approximating the length of the shortest nonzero vector to within certain polynomial factors). Our contributions include a new notion of preimage sampleable functions, simple and efficient “hash-and-sign” digital signature schemes, and identity-based encryption. A core technical component of our constructions is an efficient algorithm that, given a basis of an arbitrary lattice, samples lattice points from a discrete Gaussian probability distribution whose standard deviation is essentially the length of the longest Gram-Schmidt vector of the basis. A crucial security property is that the output distribution of the algorithm is oblivious to the particular geometry of the given basis.},

	abstract = {Lattice reduction algorithms are notoriously hard to predict, both in terms of running time and output quality, which poses a major problem for cryptanalysis. While easy to analyze algorithms with good worst-case behavior exist, previous experimental evidence suggests that they are outperformed in practice by algorithms whose behavior is still not well understood, despite more than 30 years of intensive research. This has lead to a situation where a rather complex simulation procedure seems to be the most common way to predict the result of their application to an instance. In this work we present new algorithmic ideas towards bridging this gap between theory and practice. We report on an extensive experimental study of several lattice reduction algorithms, both novel and from the literature, that shows that theoretical algorithms are in fact surprisingly practical and competitive. In light of our results we come to the conclusion that in order to predict lattice reduction, simulation is superfluous and can be replaced by a closed formula using weaker assumptions.},

  abstract={This paper proposes the first side-channel attack on FALCON—a NIST Round-3 finalist for the post-quantum digital signature standard. We demonstrate a known-plaintext attack that uses the electromagnetic measurements of the device to extract the secret signing keys, which then can be used to forge signatures on arbitrary messages. The proposed attack targets the unique floating-point multiplications within FALCON’s Fast Fourier Transform through a novel extend-and-prune strategy that extracts the sign, mantissa, and exponent variables without false positives. The extracted floating-point values are then mapped back to the secret key’s coefficients. Our attack, notably, does not require pre-characterizing the power profile of the target device or crafting special inputs. Instead, the statistical differences on obtained traces are sufficient to successfully execute our proposed differential electromagnetic analysis. The results on an ARM-Cortex-M4 running the FALCON NIST’s reference software show that approximately 10k measurements are sufficient to extract the entire key.},

	abstract = {Efficient implementations of lattice-based cryptographic schemes have been limited to only the most basic primitives like encryption and digital signatures. The main reason for this limitation is that at the core of many advanced lattice primitives is a trapdoor sampling algorithm (Gentry, Peikert, Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2008) that produced outputs that were too long for practical applications. In this work, we show that using a particular distribution over NTRU lattices can make GPV-based schemes suitable for practice. More concretely, we present the worst lattice-based IBE scheme with practical parameters – key and ciphertext sizes are between two and four kilobytes, and all encryption and decryption operations take approximately one millisecond on a moderately-powered laptop. As a by-product, we also obtain digital signature schemes which are shorter than the previously most-compact ones of Ducas, Durmus, Lepoint, and Lyubashevsky from Crypto 2013.},

abstract = {The classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows to compute in quasi-linear time the product of two polynomials, in the circular convolution ring R[x]/(xd -1) --- a task that naively requires quadratic time. Equivalently, it allows to accelerate matrix-vector products when the matrix is circulant. In this work, we discover that the ideas of the FFT can be applied to speed up the orthogonalization process of matrices with circulant blocks of size d x d. We show that, when d is composite, it is possible to proceed to the orthogonalization in an inductive way ---up to an appropriate re-indexation of rows and columns. This leads to a structured Gram-Schmidt decomposition. In turn, this structured Gram-Schmidt decomposition accelerates a cornerstone lattice algorithm: the nearest plane algorithm. The complexity of both algorithms may be brought down to Θ(d log d).Our results easily extend to cyclotomic rings, and can be adapted to Gaussian samplers. This finds applications in lattice-based cryptography, improving the performances of trapdoor functions.},
